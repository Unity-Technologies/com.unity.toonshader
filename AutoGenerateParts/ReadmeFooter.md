# Post-Cloning Setup on Windows

This repository utilizes symbolic links to share code across multiple projects. 
On Windows 10 or later, symbolic link creation is restricted by default for regular users, 
which can lead to issues when working with this repository. 

To resolve this, follow the steps below to enable symbolic link creation and configure Git appropriately.

1. Open **Local Security Policy** by typing `secpol.msc` on Windows Command Prompt

  - Click **Add User or Group**
  - Click **Object Types**
  - Make sure **Groups** is checked and click **OK**.

git config --local core.symlinks true
git config --global core.symlinks true
```
