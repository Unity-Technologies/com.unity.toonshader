# Highlight Settings

The ability to display specular highlights in a cel-animation-like manner is essential for Toon Shaders. The **Unity Toon Shader** provides a wide variety of expressions with controllability to illuminate the area independently of light color and intensity for impressive cel-shading.

## Highlight
Highlight : Texture(sRGB) Ã— Color(RGB) Default:White. Pattern and color of specularly illuminated area.

Default color.

![The same sphere, with the color picker window open and a bright red color selected. The specular highlight on the sphere is now orange and yellow.](images/Highlight1.png)<br/>
Applied different light color.


## Highlight Power

The size of the Highlight controlled through the High light power slider. The size increase with the formula: pow(x,5).


## Specular Mode

UTS provides two modes for the highlight for different occasions and effect. The hard mode provides a crisp and solid edge to the highlight while the soft mode provides a blended blurred effect.

### Color Blending Mode
Specular color blending mode allows the user to control the hardness of the colour applied to the highlight. Users have two options: Multiply or Add. Note that **Color Blending Mode** is disabled when **Specular** Mode is  **Soft**.

Add


## Highlight Blending on Shadows
Control the blending for the highlights in shadows. Please refer to the image at [Blending Level](#blending-level).

### Blending Level
Adjusts the intensity of highlight applied to shadow areas.

## Highlight Mask
A gray scale texture which utilises its brightness to control highlight intensity. Applying the highlight mask allows to fine-tune the reflectivity on the material.
