# Scene Light Effectiveness Settings

The **Unity Toon Shader** provides a way to control the effectiveness of lights in the scene per material. There are times when you want to eliminate or limit the effect of lighting on a material type.
UTS allows you to control each area color regardless of the actual light color. While this feature is fundamental to professional cel-shading, sometimes it's necessary to apply actual light colors. 
UTS provides a way to determine whether the actual light color affects the material or not.

## Light Probe Intensity

Adds the light probe color to the material color according to the **Light Probe Intensity** value.

## Limit Light Intensity

Limit the brightness of the light to 1 to avoid white-out.

Example: When a intensive directional light is on the character.

<canvas class="image-comparison" role="img" aria-label="A chibi-style character model. Limit Light Intensity is disabled. The model is brightly lit by a white light that washes out the colors. Then the same model, with Limit Light Intensity enabled. The model is lit less brightly and more naturally.">
