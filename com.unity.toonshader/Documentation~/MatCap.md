# Material Capture(MatCap) Settings

MatCap is a method of light expression using pre-rendered images. This technique uses a picture of a sphere that represents the material and light to simulate lighting.

MatCap Map disabled.

<video title="The same camera pan, but the blonde hair of the model now has a brighter yellow specular highlight." src="images/WithMatCap.mp4" width="auto" height="auto" autoplay="true" loop="true" controls></video><br/>
MatCap Map enabled.

## MatCap Blur Level
Blur MatCap Map using the Mip Map feature; to enable Mip Map, activate Advanced > Generate Mip Maps in the [Texture Import Settings](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-TextureImporter.html). Default is 0 (no blur)

## Color Blending Mode
MatCap color blending mode. Multiply or Add.



## Scale MatCap UV
Scaling UV of MatCap Map.

<video title="A close-up on the blonde hair of a chibi-style character model. The brighter yellow specular highlight changes from a thin line to a wider highlight." src="images/ScaleMatCapUV.mp4" width="auto" height="auto" autoplay="true" loop="true" controls></video>


## Rotate MatCap UV
Rotating UV of MatCap Map.

<video title="A close-up on the blonde hair of a chibi-style character model. The yellow specular highlight rotates from left to right and back." src="images/RotateMatCapUV.mp4" width="auto" height="auto" autoplay="true" loop="true" controls></video>


## Stabilize Camera Rolling
Stabilize Camera rolling when capturing materials with camera.

<video title="A close-up on the face of a chibi-style character model. When the camera rotates, the specular highlights stay in the same place in the camera view." src="images/StabilizerOff.mp4" width="auto" height="auto" autoplay="true" loop="true" controls></video><br/>
Stabilize Camera Rolling disabled.

<video title="The same close-up. When the camera rotates, the specular highlights stay in the same place on the hair." src="images/StabilizerOn.mp4" width="auto" height="auto" autoplay="true" loop="true" controls></video><br/>
Stabilize Camera Rolling enabled.


## Normal Map Specular Mask for MatCap
If enabled, gives a normal map specifically for MatCap. If you are using MatCap as speculum lighting, you can use this to mask it.

<canvas class="image-comparison" role="img" aria-label="A view from above a chibi-style character model with blonde hair and brighter yellow specular highlights. Then the same view. The individual hairs now have highlights. ">

    <img src="images/MatCapNormalMapOn.png" title="Normal Map Specular Mask enabled">
</canvas>
<br />Drag the slider to compare the images.

### Normal Map
A texture that dictates the bumpiness of the material.

### Rotate Normal Map UV
Rotates the MatCap normal map UV based on its center.

<video title="A view from above a chibi-style character model with blonde hair and brighter yellow specular highlights on individual hairs. The highlights rotate." src="images/RotateMatCapNormalMapUV.mp4" width="auto" height="auto" autoplay="true" loop="true" controls></video>


## MatCap Blending on Shadows
Enables the blending rate of the MatCap range in shadows.

<canvas class="image-comparison" role="img" aria-label="A view from above a chibi-style character model with blonde hair. With MatCap Blending on Shadows on, the bright highlights on individual hairs are less visible.">
    <img src="images/MatCapBlendingOnShadowOff.png" title="MatCap Blending on Shadows disabled.">
    <img src="images/MatCapBlendingOnShadowOn.png" title="MapCap Blending on Shadows enabled.">
</canvas>
<br />Drag the slider to compare the images.


## Blending Level
Adjusts the intensity of MatCap applied to shadow areas.


## MatCap Camera Mode
Control how render the MatCap Map based on the camera type.

## MatCap Mask
The MatCap mask is positioned correspond with the UV coordinates of the mesh onto which the MatCap is projected, and the pixels on black areas are hidden.

## MatCap Mask Level
Adjusts the level of the MatCap Mask. When the value is 1, MatCap represents 100% irrespective of mask. When the value is -1, MatCap won't be displayed at all and MatCap will be the same as in the off state.

## Invert MatCap Mask
When enabled, inverts **MatCap Mask** Texture colors.
