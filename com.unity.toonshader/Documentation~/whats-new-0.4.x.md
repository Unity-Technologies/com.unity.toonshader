## HDRP Box Light

When you want to use lighting that differs from the scene main light to make character face more clear or to add shadows that look ideal. But, in HDRP, one directional light cast shadows, not more than two. The [Box Light](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@14.0/manual/Light-Component.html#Shape) provides the solution for this. The **Unity Toon Shader** now supports the feature. For now, HDRP Ray-traced shadows isn't ready for this feature.
