### Angel Ring 
Angel Ring: Texture(sRGB) × Color(RGB). Default: Black.
By default, the **Unity Toon Shader** adds the color to the lighting results. The texture alpha channel has no effect.
Please refer to [Alpha Channel as Clipping Mask](#alpha-channel-as-clipping-mask) when alpha clipping is desirable.

### Alpha Channel as Clipping Mask

Texture alpha channel is a clipping mask. If disabled, the alpha doesn't affect at all. The color of the **Angel Ring** can directly affects instead of using the additive method.
