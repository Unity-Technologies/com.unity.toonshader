# Requirements and compatibility

## Requirements

Because the **Unity Toon Shader** is compatible with all render pipelines, 
please refer to each render pipeline's requirements documentation to see specific hardware and software requirements. 
The use of linear color space is strongly recommended.


## Unity Render Pipeline compatibility
The **Unity Toon Shader** is compatible with all render pipelines: 
the **Built-in Render Pipeline**, **Universal Render Pipeline (URP)**, 
and **High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP)**. 
However, there are some differences in the features supported by different render pipelines. 
Please refer to the [feature differences](FeatureModel_en.md) for each render pipeline for details.
