# Requirements and compatibility

## Requirements

Because the **Unity Toon Shader** is compatible with all render pipelines, please refer to each render pipeline's requirements documentation to see specific hardware and software requirements. The use of linear color space is strongly recommended.


## Unity Render Pipeline compatibility
The **Unity Toon Shader** is compatible with all render pipelines: the **Built-in Render Pipeline**, **Universal Render Pipeline (URP)**, and **High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP)**. However, there are some differences in the features supported by different render pipelines. Please refer to the feature differences for each render pipeline for details.
