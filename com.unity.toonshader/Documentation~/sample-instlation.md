# How to install samples

Unity provides **Unity Toon Shader** sample scenes for the three render pipelines. Please install the set of samples that fits the render pipeline you use.

1. Make sure the [render pipeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.2/Documentation/Manual/render-pipelines.html) you want to use is installed and set up before installing the UTS samples. 
1. Open the [Package Manager window](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.2/Documentation/Manual/Packages.html).
1. Click **Unity Toon Shader** on the left side of the window.
1. Press **Import** on the right side of the window.
1. Set the Graphics Pipeline Asset in the [Project Settings window](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.2/Documentation/Manual/comp-ManagerGroup.html). URP samples require `UTS2URPPipelineAsset`, whereas HDRP samples require `HDRenderPipelineAsset_UTS`.
